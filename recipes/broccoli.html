    <h2>Awesome Broccoli-Cheese Casserole</h2>
    <p>
      My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was
      little. We kids could never get enough! If you have children or have some
      coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they
      will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas
      ham.
