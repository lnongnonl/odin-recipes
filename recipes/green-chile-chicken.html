    <h2>Quick and Easy Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Casserole</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken enchilada casserole recipe is so good that my four picky kids
      eat it â€” and I got my picture in the paper for it! If you want to skip the
      charring step, simply tear the tortillas into quarters so they absorb the
      sauce better.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
      <li>18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Step 1</b>: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 2</b>: Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared
        baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices
        run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool,
        shred, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 3</b>: Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open flame of
        a gas stove burner using metal tongs until lightly puffed, about 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step 4</b>: Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce into the bottom of a
        medium baking dish; arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer on top.
        Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese, 1/2 of the sour
        cream, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce. Repeat layers. Coat
        remaining tortillas thoroughly with some of the remaining enchilada
        sauce and arrange on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with
        any remaining enchilada sauce
      </li>
    </ol>
